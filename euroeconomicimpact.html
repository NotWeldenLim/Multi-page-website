<h1>UEFA EURO 2024 Impact Study</h1>
<br>
<img src="https://editorial.uefa.com//resources/0290-1bb42ed19fa2-6d0c6e6f7923-1000/format/wide1/spain_v_england_final_-_uefa_euro_2024.jpeg?imwidth=988" height=700px>

        <p>According to a holistic study conducted by Nielsen Sports, the world’s leading provider of sports data measurement and fan insight, the economic impact of UEFA EURO 2024 for Germany and the ten host cities amounts to <span class="highlight">€7.44 billion</span>.</p>

        <p>More than 90% of this sum was the direct result of expenditure by the 2.7 million ticket holders (44% from abroad), organisers, and accredited persons, as well as the resulting indirect and induced economic effects. The most significant expenses included accommodation, travel to and within the host cities, and food and beverages outside and inside the stadiums. The study also found that almost two-thirds of ticket holders used public transport within the host cities.</p>

        <p>A total of <span class="highlight">€571 million</span> in advertising value was generated for the host cities and the host country combined, thanks to their presence and visibility in the global media.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin</strong> said: "UEFA EURO 2024 in Germany was an outstanding tournament and an unforgettable experience for everyone involved. The football was exceptional, the fans were delighted, and as this report clearly demonstrates, the tournament had a significant economic and social impact on the host country. This proves that major sporting events are not just a triumph for the football community but for society as a whole. As reflected in our motto – football unites people. We can already look ahead with excitement to UEFA EURO 2028 in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, as well as UEFA EURO 2032 in Italy and Türkiye."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Bernd Neuendorf</strong>, president of the German Football Association (DFB), said: "The study provides impressive evidence that UEFA EURO 2024 has had a wide range of positive effects across the ten venues and the country as a whole. Not only did it provide us with great matches and a fantastic atmosphere in the stadiums; it was also an economic and social success. Thirty-six years after EURO 1988 and 34 years after peaceful reunification, Germany has proven to be a football-loving country, a friendly host and a reliable partner for the organisation of major sporting events.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Nancy Faeser</strong>, German federal minister of the interior and community, said: "We truly turned the European football championship into our 'Heimspiel für Europa', making it a summer of sport in the heart of Europe. I’m very pleased at the study’s findings: an economic impact of <span class="highlight">7.4 billion euros</span> in Germany exceeds expectations for hosting the tournament in Germany. And I’m especially happy that the economic, social, and media impact of the tournament is directly benefitting the host cities. This wonderful tournament would not have been possible without the excellent organisational work and passionate dedication of our host cities."</p>
        </blockquote>

            <li>On average, 23% of ticket holders came from the host cities, 33% from the rest of Germany, and 44% from abroad.</li>
            <li>97% of international ticket holders said they wanted to visit Germany again. On average, 79% of ticket holders said they would recommend visiting the city that had hosted their match.</li>

            <li>73% said that EURO 2024 had made a positive contribution to the common good and cohesion in the host city.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Sustainability Efforts</h2>
        <p>UEFA and the DFB made special efforts in the area of sustainability, from the successful bid to host EURO 2024 onwards. Sustainability concepts were integrated into the bid and converted into an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategy for the tournament, backed by targeted measures and investments totaling <span class="highlight">€32 million</span>. In relation to the environment, this encompassed areas such as climate protection, sustainable infrastructure, and the circular economy. A comprehensive assessment of all work in the field of sustainability will be published as part of a comprehensive ESG report in autumn 2024.</p>

        <h2>Study Methodology</h2>
        <p>The Nielsen Sports study was based on surveys of ticket holders, cross-media monitoring, and evaluation of data from the host country, host cities, and UEFA, as well as additional expertise and knowledge from over 150 similar impact studies successfully conducted by Nielsen Sports. The full report, which includes explanations of the approach and methodology used, can be found <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
